# Whoami 
I'm a person which likes to fidget with technology, eventually I got a job where I get paid to program, and fund some of my proyects (including this one), also to pay for the ever-increasingly cost of living and the deligthful server-grade hardware that I can afford. 

## What I want this place to be:

I am open to any idea, to the point to which I'm not even sure if the entirety of this site is going to be written exclusively in one language.
So, expect anything.
But some topics I **do** want to cover are:
- Programming 
- Security 
- Linux  
- Windows
- Gaming 
- Learning 

In no specific order. 
## When 
I want to at least put out 1 post per week, as a minimum.
## Requests
Check the links on the landing page.
