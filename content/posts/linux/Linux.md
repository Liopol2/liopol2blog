Desktop Linux users are the vegans of technology, annoying and obnuxious individuals which have to let you know that they are moraly superior because they belong to **the penguin side**, but is it any truth to their claims is it any reason for a "normal" person to switch to linux?.

Today we will discuss points against and on favor of GNU/Linux Systems.

Let's start from the bad side of linux, this is a short list of reasons for you to stay away, or do some more research on the topic before jumping head first into this OS...  s? 


## Gaming
Yes I know, [Garuda](https://garudalinux.org/) , [Nobara](https://nobaraproject.org/) and proton exists, and if you like thinkering a bit with some software there is definetly a lot of gaming to do in linux, but in this post we will asume no prior experience, and neither little Timmy or any of his relatives gives a damn about formating a PC, or in some cases even know what that means.
But even considering that you can get a distro setup for gaming, there is some specific cases where you will need to run windows natively. 

## Anticheats
There are a bunch of this programs that run at a driver level on windows even starting before the system, some of the most infamous ones are Vanguard and mhyprot2.sys. 
If some of the games that you play have this kind of software you will have no option but to run on windows, there probably is a way to circumvent this softwares, but not without putting your account in risk, so in my humble opinion, I'd stay away.

## Adobe/Final Cut
The Adobe suite of programs sins in a lots of ways, like [trying to copyright colors](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/1/23434305/adobe-pantone-subscription-announcement-photoshop-illustrator), and then getting into lawsuits for *aledgedly* forcing you to pay a hard and extremely expensive to opt out subscription hiding this costs deep down in the small letters of the EULA, and of course, having proprietary software which as far as I know is not compatible with Linux. 


## Native Linux Games
It's not al gloom and doom, only DOOM. 
A lot of games are compatible out of the box with linux, and the 2016 FPS is one of the titles that enjoys the benefit of native compatibility, in some cases with a performance increase over windows.
And there's an ever-increasingly big list of titles that can be played to completion in linux, wanna know if your favorite games are supported , look [here](https://www.protondb.com/explore)

## Just works distros
One of the benefits of open source software is that you can customize your system to your liking, but you might not need to do so, since there is a huge quantity of linux distros destined for all purposes how there, if you need a place where to search look no further than [distrowatch](https://www.distrowatch.com).

And here's a list of my personal recomendations in no particular order.
|Distro|Base|Application| Remarks|
|---------------|-------------|-------------|---------|
|[Garuda Linux](https://garudalinux.org/)|Archlinux|Gaming|It comes with a bunch of options for DE, and a installer that includes most of the tools that you will ever need.     
|
|[Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/)|Ubuntu/Debian|Desktop|Solid distro, this particular distro is ubuntu with KDE, there's a lot of information on ubuntu in general and also a lot of info for kubuntu specifically, recommended for newbies. 
|
|[Arcolinux](https://www.arcolinux.info/)|Archlinux|Desktop|All around good distro, you really can feel the effort in the development, really polished, it's a more minimal version but decently featured.
|
|[Peppermint OS](https://peppermintos.com/)|Debian|Desktop|I recommend this for low spec x64 PCs, this distro is also really good for newbies, it includes a lot of tools that allow you to not depend on the terminal as much, and that help fix a lot of common issues.
|
|[Antix](https://antixlinux.com)|Debian|Desktop|If you have a dinosaur x86 pc, this is your distro, it runs apt as package manager since is a debian derivative, really lightweight with a bunch of Windows Managers to choose from. 
|
|[PopOS](https://pop.system76.com/)|Ubuntu/Debian|Desktop/Gaming|If you have a gaming laptop with a nvidia GPU, install this one, it comes with all the drivers out of the box, you can change the gpu usage from the control panel, and it's quite stable and polished, the only drawback is that it comes with GNOME.|


### But why Linux users hate windows?
Well to be brief, it's more bloatware and spyware than OS at this point.
If you happen to experience the windows golden era when Windows XP and Windows 7 when where no mandatory windows account, and little to no telemetry, a lot of widget that nobody used, and this mythic background. 
![bliss](../bliss.jpeg)  
This times when the computer will serve you, never stand in your way, outside of the UAC that windows 7 started to include, which for the time was somewhat annoying but understandably introduced to restrict and give you more visibility and control of some random software of undefined procedure. 
Also times where the updates were mostly on the background and you would have the called Service Packs which were the big updates that came far and apart,  and also some minor patches that would not prompt you to restart your pc every 30 minutes

And this is basically what linux allows you to do, the system is **yours**, I will do whatever you what it to do.
- Do you want to completely change the behaviour of your system?
    - Sure.
- Do you not feel like updating?
    - Your choice.
- Do you want a new desktop environment?
    - A bit involved, but achievable.
- Do you want just a window manager
    - *Fancy* , for which compositor?
- You want to ` $ rm -rf / ` your whole system ?
    - Sure thing, 
    - *Altough some systems will have some alerts in place so you don't do the equivalent of delete system32 on linux*
    - But if you want to do it, it will allow you to.

The world is your oyster!

If you are looking to make the switch go ahead, there's no time like today.
If you don't know how to get started try running any distro on a usb drive or in a virtual machine, there's a lot of forums and communities of people willing to help.
And for all the already linux users , please don't be pushy, the last thing we need is gatekeepers, and people trying to force a system down peoples throat, and that only ends up generating rejection even if it's for a good reason. 

That's all for now.

Thanks for reading!
